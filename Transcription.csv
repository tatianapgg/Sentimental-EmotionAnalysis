1.mp4;Terrible quality. The ship wasn't even straight on the base. Hot glue strings everywhere.
2.mp4;My husband loved this  set. The quality was good and shipping was fast. Great buy.
3.mp4;The toy broke within minutes of opening the box.
4.mp4;So cute and fluffy
5.mp4;Great little truck, son loves it and plays with it all the time.
6.mp4;Love these for on the go entertainment. No mess!
7.mp4;This stroller pretty much only fits Fisher Prices little cloth doll.  My daughter can't use it for her Bitty Baby, or most of her other dolls.
8.mp4;Nice Product!
9.mp4;Perfect Christmas gift
10.mp4;Gift for Granddaughter and she loves them
11.mp4;As advertised.
12.mp4;Can't go wrong with Melissa and Doug
13.mp4;lucky to get one for the kids for Christmas.  They loved it.
14.mp4;Very cheap quality, but it did the trick.
15.mp4;Was a gift and I never heard if they liked it. Sorry, I can't help you.
16.mp4;A very nice addition to my growing Pop collection. It arrived on time & she's adorable.
17.mp4;my sun really liked it
18.mp4;Fabric is nice and heavy and the emblems are colorful and intricate.  This was so affordable.  Workmanship is very good and fit is exact for AG.
19.mp4;Does not do much. Granddaughter loves the one Princess song and that is all. I thought it would offer more interaction
20.mp4;Jesse my ten month old loves to play with them soft and squeshy
21.mp4;Bought for red-haired Grandson. I hope he likes it. It is really cute.
22.mp4;Great addition to our dinosaur party!
23.mp4;We purchased this cat for our daughter and she loves it! The colors and details are great. Highly recommended. The fur is soft and cuddly.
24.mp4;These are great paint holders. Made painting with numerous paint colors with my toddlers much easier! Highly recommend
25.mp4;Perfect, Shipped safely, and fast.
26.mp4;These were great. I added to my vest for a true 80's look.
27.mp4;kids liked it
28.mp4;smaller than I had expected
29.mp4;I pulled high rarity cards and left me happy 
30.mp4;My granddaughter loves using this tray for her snacks when she comes to visit.
31.mp4;Huge waste of money and so disappointed.  Never worked and we followed the directions and everything.
32.mp4;Got what I paid for, I like it and as long as you follow the instructions it is awesome. The kids love their new theater.
33.mp4;"I'm not usually a fan of cooperative games, but this is actually really fun; by far the best I've played."
34.mp4;Very cheap quality. Definitely not worth the price.
35.mp4;Fun puzzle!  My eight and nine year old boys loved putting this together and then using it on their desk.
36.mp4;Kid loved the costume.  Many compliments!
37.mp4;smaller than I thought it would be
38.mp4;Very nice costume. Just bummed that I had to pay another six dollars to get the pendant, or it would be really Katniss.
39.mp4;Excellent
40.mp4;Great price!  My daughter will be thrilled when we give this to her to use for an airplane trip overseas.
41.mp4;The mat does not work anymore, and we have sparingly used it. Not reliable.
42.mp4;This police costume is the most adorable I have found so far, but the quality terrible! Coming apart at the seams right out of the bag,
43.mp4;Small but great price
44.mp4;They work amazing I got them on all my stuff
45.mp4;My child lost interest after five minutes.
46.mp4;All five of ours made it! three year old daughter loved the experience. Highly recommend and would do again next year.
47.mp4;the product came in an envelope and when i opened it, the box was dented, torn. thankfully it wasn't a gift. pieces were loose fitting as usual.
48.mp4;It is a fun game.
49.mp4;Seams don't hold together with weight from books
50.mp4;Was fun watching my grandkids waiting for the hatching. Some of the dinosaurs were misformed.
51.mp4;Love the value that this truck showed along with the assembly. I'd order again if I needed too. No damages or late arrivals.
52.mp4;My kid loves lego and loves minecraft. He likes the creepers, so we got him this set. He also likes the mine carts. Awesome lego set!
53.mp4;I bought this for my 2 year old son. It's really cute and well made
54.mp4;Excellent for home and as a gift. I purchase two complete sets for home and college.
55.mp4;Well, built and nicely made!  I ended up tossing my fisher price version after I got this.  The rattle in the pieces is a huge bonus!!!
56.mp4;These hand puppets are so cute.  Just as pictured and of course Melissa & Doug toys are always adorable and great quality.
57.mp4;Fun stocking stuffer
58.mp4;Nice set for my grandson!
59.mp4;"Some of the ""dirt"" is starting to fade."
60.mp4;overpriced and not snuggly
61.mp4;This is a beautiful puzzle, unfortunately my son was only interested in it for about a month before he was ready to move on to puzzles with more pieces.
62.mp4;Very cute! My daughter loves it. Perfect for any shopkins fan. Great size too.
63.mp4;Grandson loves his Melissa and Doug puzzles. First thing he goes to in his play room.
64.mp4;love it
65.mp4;My eight years old son loved it!
66.mp4;Husband loves it.
67.mp4;Quite big, but nice
68.mp4;I thought they would be bigger, but after the party was over, they turned out just fine.  I would recommend them to another person.
69.mp4;Excelente
70.mp4;The party game Headbands for children,  and it's Disney themed!  Very fun and entertaining for children and adults!
71.mp4;I love it! Kids spend hours with it.
72.mp4;My two year old son and I love playing with this. We count the pieces, place pizza orders and play flip the pizza!
73.mp4;Great paint and finish, the BAD its the size...did not see on time. and the price...way to much
74.mp4;granddaughter loved it
75.mp4;Arrived damaged and missing pieces.
76.mp4;I got this for a friend as a graduation gift and he loves it. He's already excited for a desk job so he can display Brees!!
77.mp4;my niece loved it
78.mp4;My granddaughter loves it!!
79.mp4;Batteries died almost immediately. Waste of money.
80.mp4;bought as a gift for a three year old and he loves it.
81.mp4;Amazing detail
82.mp4;Not much to say about a pad of paper but it is very nice and a great gift for a four year old!
83.mp4;Awesome
84.mp4;Good product, great price. Thanks!
85.mp4;I love this game because it helps you with grammar, and making silly, funny sentences. I recommend this game to kids from third grade to adult.
86.mp4;Love those news
87.mp4;if you love lego, this won't change your mind....my five year old plays with this
88.mp4;Trying to get our money back. This is the worst thing ever. if it worked it would be great. Nothing works on this, My grand children are very sad.
89.mp4;Great!!!
90.mp4;Awesome!  We love the music, lights and remote option.
91.mp4;This is one of my granddaughters’ favorite toys.  It arrived on time and was easy to put together.
92.mp4;Great buy
93.mp4;Great toy! My son really likes it and he's used it for over a year.
94.mp4;Great mix of sand toys and the quality seems good.
95.mp4;My two year old loves this puzzle. Pieces are sturdy and fit together easily for a little one, love melissa and doug toys.
96.mp4;Amazing , a little shorter than I thought cause it's shorter than my other gundamns
97.mp4;Instructions were confusing and incomplete.
98.mp4;my daughter loves this.
99.mp4;Smaller than I thought it would be, but still cute
100.mp4;eight year old grandson loved it.
101.mp4;It's a little smaller than I thought but it will be the perfect cuddly toy for my daughter.
102.mp4;my grandson loved it and it arrived on the time it was projected to arrive!
103.mp4;My grandson loves this. He loves the size, the colors , the lights and the sounds. He enjoys playing with this fire truck
104.mp4;Felt like a dollar store item.
105.mp4;My grandkids were so excited to get these for their birthday! They LOVE to play cards and always drop them. Not any more!
106.mp4;Kids Loved it.
107.mp4;Much more inexpensive than buying these from Justice. Bought as birthday gifts for my seven year old.
108.mp4;The favorite toy has to get five stars, right?
109.mp4;The kids really loved this toy
110.mp4;Fun toy but my two year old got bored pretty quickly after playing with it a few times.
111.mp4;Goes perfect with an outfit I bought my neices doll for Christmas. Style is great. Also this is a match of the shoes my neice wears.
112.mp4;Purchased this game for my four year old.  He loves it!  And it is fun to play with him!
113.mp4;Extremely loud and annoying. Not kid friendly.
114.mp4;So cute perfect for the barbies.
115.mp4;My kid loves this, sleeps with it every night.
116.mp4;These card protectors work and look nice on cards. The cards fit snugly inside and they do not slide around or stick out of the bottom.
117.mp4;My two and four year old love this water slide,  They have played in it everyday the past week.  Its twenty dollars well spent, I recommend to other parents.
118.mp4;Stopped working after one day.
119.mp4;My five year old daughter loves them.
120.mp4;Came just like the picture great product
121.mp4;My kids found it boring and repetitive.
122.mp4;These are so great, big hit with my one year old.
123.mp4;There are several models of this launch pad but do yourself a favor and buy this one.  You'll be glad you did.
124.mp4;Very powerful thinner. Just some concern on the smell.
125.mp4;The balls are sturdy and do not crush with normal play.
126.mp4;While not a cool as the Cute but Deadly Blizzard figures, still a nice addition to the collection
127.mp4;Very cool.its a nice addition to my man cave collection. Thanks !!!
128.mp4;Even awesomeness
129.mp4;The main gift for two of my grandsons. I see years of fun with this gift.
130.mp4;get this definitely its fun
131.mp4;Great deal for a large classroom setting.
132.mp4;Super fun and great price!
133.mp4;I got this for my son for his 4th birthday.  Spiderman does not stay on the bike, and my son gets really frustrated with it.
134.mp4;New cards, what could go wrong ?
135.mp4;too cute for words. our niece loved it...for a week, but, that's her, not the product.
136.mp4;We bought one of those over the door basketball nets for the kitchen for the kids.  This ball works great . Highly recommend it.
137.mp4;bought when they were $3.50 or so. Great at that price. Not work more than $10 for sure.
138.mp4;adorable
139.mp4;The sounds are annoying. I wish you could turn the volume down. My son loves it though-18 months!
140.mp4;I got them for my 15 month old they squirt down words though he just likes trying to be drowned them in the tub and watch them pop back up.
141.mp4;Paint was chipped right out of the box.
142.mp4;Doesn’t look like the picture at all.
143.mp4;Overpriced for such poor quality.
144.mp4;I used this for geo catching and they fit nicely into the cashes
145.mp4;my 5 year old will love this for his hot wheel monster jam trucks it will make hauling them all over easier.
146.mp4;10 year old son loved it!
147.mp4;Pretty cool. The little drone and the K9 were fun to build.
148.mp4;Fits great!
149.mp4;What you see is what you get! The extra weird connectors are pretty cool.
150.mp4;was a birthday gift for my son, he took it out of the box, touched it once to make the head bobble and it broke.  Disappointing!
151.mp4;Awesome.  It's high quality, well built, and has good detail.
152.mp4;Love this set great creative play time fun
153.mp4;Great little piano !
154.mp4;Bought as a gift, their daughter loved it. Helps make moms pregnancy a little more about the kids they already have, includes them in the process
155.mp4;the only way my daughter will build because she likes books. They're fun. This one seems a little more abstract in the building part, but good
156.mp4;Dangerous small parts not mentioned in description.
157.mp4;Wish he was a bit bigger, but it's still a good plush toy. Nice details.
158.mp4;It’s flimsy and falls apart easily.
159.mp4;Bought this set for Kinetic Sand. It's perfect and especially for the price. Great buy.
160.mp4;Perfect for preschoolers as letter and sound recognition all in one.  Perfect for four year olds.
161.mp4;The paint is a little off, but it feels good in hand
162.mp4;Precious. We have a collection started.
163.mp4;5 year old loved these for Christmas!!
164.mp4;Didn’t work properly even once.
165.mp4;"Fun for kids to ""help"" mom with chores!"
166.mp4;I love this puzzle!  It is fun and the pieces are bigger and the subject is wonderful.
167.mp4;The worst toy we’ve ever bought.
168.mp4;Great product, quick shipping!
169.mp4;Disappointed. It looked fun but wasn’t.
170.mp4;Very frustrating to assemble. Poor design.
171.mp4;These are cute, and my daughter loves them, just wish they were bigger, and all milk and juice disappeared. But it's a good product.
172.mp4;they don't really work.
173.mp4;My son loved this for Christmas
174.mp4;easy to put up, kids (5-6 years old) loved it
175.mp4;My granddaughter plays with this all the time.
176.mp4;WOW, she's adorably cute. Love hello kitty, even if she is no longer in vogue. Makes me smile :)
177.mp4;This was a christmas gift to my granddaughter, she enjoyed color it!!
178.mp4;My son love the kitchen! It's a little bit work to put it together, but its worth it!
179.mp4;My son loves these, but you can buy them cheaper at the Disney store. Cute toys, decent quality, lots of fun for little Mater fans!
180.mp4;Not suitable for the recommended age group.
181.mp4;Bought this for Halloween, but my toddler already found it and LOVES it (may be buying second)! Can't beat the price, and it looks just like Elsa's dress
182.mp4;Our Grandson that is 2 years loved these.  PErfect size to play with and carry around. Great service
183.mp4;Great figure, but SO SMALL.
184.mp4;Better than I expected, seems like the good old fashion turtles' toys. Reminds me of the ones my parents bought me when I was younger. Happy with this one.
185.mp4;One of the funniest games I have played with my family and with my students. It is a must.
186.mp4;My grandson was over the moon with this.  I was too... especially given the price!
187.mp4;got it for my daughter’s birthday party to decorate. kids loved them and quality is great
188.mp4;Feels like it will break if touched.
189.mp4;Love this. I just wished it came with a better variety of colors.
190.mp4;not particularly interesting, kids were bored rather quickly
191.mp4;Doll came on time with no issues
192.mp4;This gorilla is impressive, from the paint job to the posture is in, looks live like.
193.mp4;I love it. It's excellent. Very pleased!!!!!
194.mp4;Made my child cry — awful experience.
195.mp4;kids love chalk! great gift
196.mp4;totally loved these and were great quality
197.mp4;Bought it for a parting gift for my daughter's bday. It was a hit.
